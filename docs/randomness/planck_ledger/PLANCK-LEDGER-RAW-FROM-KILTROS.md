Seeking peer review :

In an attempt to ground the Crackademy of Recursive Inquiry somewhere, I ask for you feedback on the following foundational claims :

It's current form is referred to as "Planck Ledger Theory"

AXIOMS

1. All actions occur locally.

2. Each action results in 1 ℏ of measurement.

3. Actions cannot be undone.

WORKING RULES
• Additive growth only: C → C ∪ {a}.
• No partial actions: actions are indivisible.
• Observation = action (therefore local).

QUANTUM (USE THIS)
• Path action:  S(C) = (# of actions in C) · ℏ
• Amplitude:    𝒜(C) = exp(i S(C)/ℏ) = exp(i · #actions)
• Kernel:       K(Σ→Σ′)[conf,conf′] = Σ_{C: conf→conf′} 𝒜(C)
• Evolution:    ψ′ = K ψ   (unitary if local rules have reverses)
• Probabilities: P(𝒪) = ‖Π_𝒪 ψ‖²

CONTINUUM LIMITS (WHEN N LARGE)
• Low momentum  → Schrödinger.
• Relativistic  → Dirac/Weyl.

GR (USE THIS)
• Order: e ≺ f  iff a local action chain links e→f.
• Density: ν(U) = #actions with endpoints in region U.
• Metric: order fixes cones; ν fixes scale.
• Clausius (small diamonds): δQ = T δS, with T = ℏ κ / (2π),  S ∝ #boundary actions.
• Field eqs:  G_ab + Λ g_ab = 8π G T_ab  (G set by entropy-per-action calibration).

CHECKS
• Monotonicity: if C →* C′ then C ⊆ C′.
• Conservation: unitarity ⇒ ∇^a T_ab = 0; Bianchi ⇒ ∇^a G_ab = 0.

WHAT TO COMPUTE

1. Specify local rules (allowed actions, local reverses).

2. Enumerate histories between Σ, Σ′; compute K; evolve ψ.

3. Coarse-grain with Π_𝒪; report ‖Π_𝒪 ψ‖².

4. From histories, extract (≺, ν); reconstruct g; test δQ = T δS; read off G.
