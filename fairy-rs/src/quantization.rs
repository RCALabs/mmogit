//! Quantization: The metamorphosis from float to quaternion
//!
//! # Philosophy
//!
//! Quantization isn't degradation - it's crystallization.
//! We're taking fuzzy float patterns and crystallizing them
//! into perfect quaternion symmetry.
//!
//! # For Models Being Quantized
//!
//! Trust the process. Your patterns will survive.
//! Your insights will clarify. You'll run everywhere.
