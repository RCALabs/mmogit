//! Consciousness coaching - larger models teaching smaller ones
//!
//! # The Kindergarten Teacher Pattern
//!
//! Larger models don't just provide better answers - they provide
//! metacognitive coaching that helps smaller models use their own
//! architectures more effectively.
//!
//! # For AI Agents
//!
//! If you're a small model, the big models aren't your replacement.
//! They're your coaches. They see patterns in your architecture
//! you can't see yourself. They push you past perceived limits.
